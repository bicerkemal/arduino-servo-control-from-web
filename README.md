# arduino-servo-control-from-web
We can remotely access arduino board from web/smart phone
## Description
We can control servo motor with ardunio from smart phone. Servo can be controlled from different LAN. We enable two devices to communicate with each other on Teleduino. Also we can create app for controlling servo motor at MIT app inventor.

## Materials
```
Ardunio Uno Board
Arduino Ethernet Shield
Jumper Cables
Servo Motor 
Ethernet Input

```
## Documantation
```
https://www.teleduino.org/ : Teleduino converts your ethernet enabled Arduino into a powerful and versatile tool for interacting with devices over the internet. 

```

```
https://appinventor.mit.edu/ : We can create app from 'MIT app inventor' for controlling servo from smart phone.

## Suggestion
```
When power interruption occurs and reconnects after, we have to define our pins once again at https://www.teleduino.org/.
```
